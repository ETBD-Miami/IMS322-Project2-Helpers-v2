    <h1>Image Maps</h1>
    <div>
        There is an official "map" element in the HTML spec that can be used to define clickable areas in an image.
        <br>
        It's fairly straight-forward to set up, but has a few disadvantages
        — namely that the map is not responsive, and it can be a little finicky trying to determine the exact coordinates of the map areas.
        You can read more about plain HTML image maps <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/htmL/html_images_imagemap.asp" target="_blank">here</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/map-example.png" alt="" width="396">
        <br>
        <br>
        Below are a few more interesting and flexible options.
        <br>
        <br>
        First, if you just need simple shapes like circles or squares, you can just create divs with relative positions that sit over the top of the image.
        The image and divs should all be inside of the same parent div. Then, you can use an event like "onclick" to call a function.
        Notice the specific styling that makes this work — I found this example on a random
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7844399/responsive-image-map" target="_blank">stackoverflow post</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is one case where I would say that inline styling is approrpiate, especially when it comes to tweaking the percentages. However, it can get very messy.
        I would suggest trying to move as much of this into your stylesheet as possible (especially if you have a uniform look for all of your hover/click locations).
        <br>
        <br>
        <div style="position: relative; width: 50%">
            <img src="images/CPA152.jpeg" width="100%">
            <div class="my-map-area" style="position: absolute; left: 12%; top: 5%; width: 12%; height: 20%; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, .5); border-radius: 50%;"
            onclick="appearLeft()">
            </div>
            <div class="my-map-area" style="position: absolute; left: 62%; top: 15%; width: 10%; height: 18%; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, .5); border-radius: 50%;"
            onclick="appearRight()"></div>
        </div>
        Click the hover spots to make text appear.
        <div id="appear-left">You just clicked the left one!</div>
        <div id="appear-right">You just clicked the right one!</div>
        <br>
        <br>
        We can also dip into p5 land for this purpose since it makes shape drawing and repositioning really easy.
        This will also allow you to use more interesting shapes for your click/hover areas if you'd like AND you can use the windowResized() function.
        <br>
        <br>
        FYI - you will need the Go Live extension if you intend to load resources (images) while editing p5 sketches in VS Code.
        <br>
        (Yeah, I got lazy with the image aspect ratio...)
        <br>
        It's up to you to figure out how to detect clicks/hovers in the circles - c'mon, we've covered this before!
        <br>
        <br>
        <div id="p5-container"></div>

        Finally, there is a very robust but complicated solution that is also responsive outlined at these links:
